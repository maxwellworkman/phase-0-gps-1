# Reflection

* I didn't really understand the push-pull terminology of Git before. 

* That was explained very clearly by Matthew. 

* I asked Andrew and Matthew to refresh me on some of the git terminal commands, I could have looked them up myself but I was driving.  

* I'm not too confused about Git anymore, I guess I'd like to know how to revert files if possible.

* I thought Matthew was very informative and willing to help us out.  Andrew was good-natured and eager to catch up on the material.  Overall, I don't think pairing made a lot of sense for this assignment, but it was a good experience anyway.
